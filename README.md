A proposal for a "non-blocking atomic wait" for ECMAScript, primarily
for use in agents that are not allowed to block.

Champions: Shu-yu Guo (Mozilla) and Lars T Hansen (Mozilla).

See [PROPOSAL.md](PROPOSAL.md) for the evolving proposal text,
[polyfill.js](polyfill.js) for a simple polyfill implementation, and
[example.html](example.html) for some examples and test cases; this
file uses the polyfill.
